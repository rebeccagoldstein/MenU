# What is MenU?

MenU is a fun and interactive app users can go to in order to find secret menu items from their favorite restaurants such as Starbucks, Dutch Bros, and Sonic! Each secret item is stored in a card which users can click on and it will then reveal a description and recipe for that item.

Users are able to create an account and save secret items they are interested in and even add their own creations which will post to the specific restaurants page!

# Future Development Plans

In the future we plan to add more restaurants and food items. We want this to be the one stop shop for all your secret MenU item needs! No more endless searches on the web to find tasty drinks and food that'll make all your friends jealous!
