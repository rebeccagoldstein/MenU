# What is MenU?

MenU is a fun and interactive app users can navigate to in order to find secret menu items from their favorite restaurant such as Starbucks, Dutch Bros, and Sonic! Each secret item is stored in a card which users can click on and it will then reveal a description and recipe for that item.

Users are able to create an account and save secret items they are interested in and even create their own which will post to the specific restaurants page!
